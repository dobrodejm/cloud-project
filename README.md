Cloud project
=============
This is a personal project where I aim to demonstrate my capabilities as a DevOps Engineer. 
I will be using this project to learn and demonstrate the following technologies:  
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Application monitoring - Prometheus,Grafana
- [ ] IaC - Terraform

This is a rough plan of what I want to achieve with this project. I will be updating this README as I go along.

The application running is an unmodified version of the **Symfony Demo Application**.
